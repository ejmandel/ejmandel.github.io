        <h2>How is materiality manifested in poor images?</h2>

      <div class="bodytextonly">
        <p>Hito Steyerl in the chapter “In Defense of the Poor Image” of
          the book <i>The Wretched of the Screen</i> explains the
          “poor image,” or the low resolution rendition of what once existed
          at a much richer quality. From his writing, we can glean that Steyerl
          sees that poor images essentially represent the easy spread of the
          digital image, specifically at a lower, “poorer” resolution, “images
          that can be made and seen by many” (Steyerl 41). In this sense, the
          low res image has become a commodity in that it is cheaply processed
          and distributed at mass volume. An example of the poor image at work
          in the cultural sphere lies in the notion of bootlegging. By pirating
          or ripping media, either visual or aural, from its original source and
          recoding it, one creates a poor image that allows a larger audience to
          experience the bootlegged piece. In my opinion, though this may be a
          bit of a stretch, another good example of this concept is the knock-off
          merchandise sold outside of concert venues. Though this doesn’t
          necessarily have to do with motion-picture art, in a way this is a poor
          image of an artists design and branding on official merchandise that has
          been reproduced at lower quality with lower skill to be purchased for
          less money by a willing crowd.</p>
