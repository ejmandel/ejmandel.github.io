      Cybernetics: All Watched Over by
      Machines of Loving Grace Pt. II

    <div class="question">
      What was the cultural impact of cybernetics?
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      The largest cultural impact that came about in regards to cybernetics,
      in my opinion, was the counterculture movement in the 1970s that adopted
      Buckminster Fuller’s ideology and created various experimental communities.
      Fuller philosophized, based on cybernetic principles, that humans are only
      nodes in a larger universal system. He thought that we ought to be less
      interested in individualistic concepts and more concerned with the
      wellbeing of the larger system at hand. Further, Buckminster Fuller
      explains that, as humans, we should take into account the glorious systems
      utilized in nature and replicate for our own use, hence the architecture of
      his famous geodesic dome structure. In terms of cultural impact, those
      involved in the counterculture of the 1970s strongly identified with Fuller’s
      concepts and began to create experimental societies. They were essentially
      communes that saw themselves as part of a larger ecological system. Politics
      were essentially forbidden, and there was a general lack of hierarchy.
      Connectivity was valued highly.
