      <h2>What is the difference between diagrams for art and non-art?</h2>

      <p>The diagram, upon first glance, is a rather dry concept to many.
        Simply put, it is a device through which seemingly technical or complex
        topics can be broken down and efficiently communicated to a viewer. As
        viewers, we usually associate diagrams with fact. Dr. Michael Whittle,
        however, discusses Shusaku Arakawa and Madeline Gins’ <i>The Mechanism of
        Meaning</i> and reveals that diagrams pertaining to art and non-art subjects
        tend to differ.</p>

      <p>In the context of non-art ideas and concepts, as mentioned previously,
          the diagram is a means of information visualization. The diagram
          methodologically lays out information in an easily digestible format to
          be further synthesized. A greater understanding of the information’s
          meaning is usually gleaned. Diagrams are often used for instructions;
          they are organizational tools.</p>

      <p>Duchamp, Arakawa, and Gins utilize diagrams in almost the opposite sense
        for artistic purpose. Specifically within <i>The Mechanism of Meaning</i>,
        Arakawa and Gins break the normalized use of the diagram and implement it to
        reverse organized meaning, instead creating paradoxes, raising questions
        on subjectivity, and pondering the very fabric of reality as we
        understand it. Whittle explains, “Objectivity and systems of scientific
        measure and analysis are taken to their limits, in order to reveal their
        tenuous philosophical underpinnings” (Whittle 2017). Essentially, the
        diagram as it pertains to art is used to further complicate what the viewer
        may have thought of as simple or one dimensional (like a lemon, for
        example). The diagram, when married with the free expression of the human
        soul that is art, forces the viewer to reexamine their perception of
        reality. </p>

      <p>Here are some examples of artistic diagrams that I appreciate</p>
