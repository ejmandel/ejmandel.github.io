    <h2 style="color: #ff0000">How was the internet
       shaped by objectivism?</h2>

    <p>Obectivism laid the groundwork for the internet in the sense that
    the entity was created as an outlet through which one could ideally
    exist in a more democratic space lacking the bureaucratic hierarchies
    of the physical world. On the internet, many believe that one woman or
    man should be her or his own boss, their own person driving them towards
    productive work. Ayn Rand's philosophy calls for a higher priority for
    absolute individual rights, an idea that has been important and percolating
    on the internet since its creation. Many of those involved in the development
    and evolution of the web place emphasis on the right of the individual when
    it comes to facets such as personal privacy and security as well as economic
    freedom, both having to do very much with panoptical sentiments related to
    the government.<p>
